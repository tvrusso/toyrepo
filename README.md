# toyrepo-internal

A toy repo for me to play with while investigating various repo
splitting and sharing options.

The purpose of "toyrepo-internal" will be to simulate the actual Xyce
repo on gitlab.  It will be the main development repo.

We will create a separate branch for public consumption that will
exclude the early history of the project.  This will be maintained in
sync with master and only this branch will be "published" to a
separate gitlab repo, "toyrepo-external".
