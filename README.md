# toyrepo-internal

A toy repo for me to play with while investigating various repo
splitting and sharing options.

The purpose of "toyrepo-internal" will be to simulate the actual Xyce
repo on gitlab.  It will be the main development repo.

We will create a separate branch for public consumption that will
exclude the early history of the project.  This will be maintained in
sync with master and only this branch will be "published" to a
separate gitlab repo, "toyrepo-external".


Please note that the GitHub repo associated with this project is NOT
the full repo as maintained by the project, and we have explicitly
disallowed reporting of issues using the GitHub issue tracker.  One is
expected to use the project mailing list to report problems.

Due to the nature of the project's funding and release approvals, we
are not likely to accept pull requests made on GitHub.
